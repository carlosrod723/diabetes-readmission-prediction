The first step is to explore the data to understand its structure, contents, and potential issues that need to be addressed before proceeding with analysis. Given that the data is in a CSV file, we will use pandas to read it and display the first 5 rows and all columns.

The dataset contains information about patient encounters, demographics, medications, diagnoses, and readmission status. Many columns are already of type int64, which is suitable for our analysis. However, some columns that should be numeric are currently classified as objects, likely due to non-numeric characters. Additionally, there are missing values represented as '?'.

Given that the columns max_glu_serum and A1Cresult have a large number of missing values, we will drop them. We will replace the '?' character with nulls in the remaining columns and then convert the relevant columns to numeric.

We will also convert the age column to an ordered categorical type for easier analysis and modeling later.

Since the data is already in a CSV format, we can directly import it into PostgreSQL. We will assume that the column names in the CSV file match the column names in the PostgreSQL table.
